# Validation helper for ActiveRecord derived objects that cleanly and simply
# allows the model to check if the given string is a syntactically valid email
# address (by using the RFC822 module above).
#
# Original code by Ximon Eighteen <ximon.eightee@int.greenpeace.org> which was
# heavily based on code I can no longer find on the net, my apologies to the
# author!
#
# Huge credit goes to Dan Kubb <dan.kubb@autopilotmarketing.com> for
# submitting a patch to massively simplify this code and thereby instruct me
# in the ways of Rails too! I reflowed the patch a little to keep the line
# length to a maximum of 78 characters, an old habit.
